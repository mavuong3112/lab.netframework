    <h1>Cats and Dogs</h1>
    <p class="question">
      I have a cat, and am thinking of getting a dog. Will they fight?
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea that dogs hate cats may have been born because dogs chase cats and grew
      because cartoons depicted ongoing battles between the two species. Or it may have
      been generated because some dog people strongly dislike cats and some cat people
      disdain dogs. However, dogs and cats can live peaceably as long as owners understand
      the behaviors of each.

      In some cases, a resident cat will isolate itself when a puppy is added to the
      family. In other cases, cats and dogs never get used to each other. In still other
      cases, cat or kitten and dog or puppy play together and build a friendship that finds
      them curled up together in a crate or bed and drinking out of the same bowl. The type
      of relationship developed in each household depends on the personality of the animals
      and the understanding of the owners.
