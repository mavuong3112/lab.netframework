      <p>Much of the advice people give about studying is wrong.</p>

      <p>Always study in the same place?</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong!</p>

      <p>Study one topic intensively before going on to the next?</p>
      <p class="wrong">Wrong!</p>

      <p>Here are some study tips that are based on <strong>actual research</strong>.</p>

      <p class="source">
        From <em>Forget What You Know About Good Study Habits</em>, by Benedict Carey,
        published in the <em>New York Times</em> on September 6, 2010.

      <h2>Alternate study environments</h2>
      <p>
        Study in the library, in the coffee shop, in your room, â€¦ Varying the place you
        study helps you remember more.
      </p>

      <h2>Mix content</h2>
      <p>
        Study a bit of this, a bit of that, some this again, some of the other.
        Switching content helps you remember more.
      </p>

      <h2>Space study sessions</h2>
      <p>
        Three one-hour sessions is more effective than one three-hour session.
      </p>

      <h2>Self-testing</h2>
      <p>
        Test yourself, or have a buddy do it. It helps you know how well you know.

      <p>CoreDogs is good at this. That's what the review system is for.</p>
